Welcome to the CaseFabric Training Session. In this session, we will guide you through the features and functionalities of CaseFabric and build a model that grows in complexity when it touches upon all CMMN plan items and CaseFabric capabilities.

## The Use Case

Let's begin the training session with a use case. Think of a company that is in the business of social services. Company name: Civix.

The clients of Civix can have many different backgrounds, for example: young people with a difficult home situation or refugees and asylum seekers. There can be many more client situations. Most clients have a mix of issues, not just one main issue.

For this case we assume the following: a homeless person knocks on Civix's door and is assigned to the case owner 'Lana' to handle his situation. Being to find a suitable home for the client. This is mostly not a straightforward, not known upfront process. Many departments and people, both from inside and outside the organization may need to collaborate. Many decisions need to be taken along the line to help the client. Lana will build and execute a client dossier for this. This dossier in the remainder of this training will be named the Case.

## **The goal**

**Find a housing solution for this client. Lana will be the main responsible person in Civix to achieve this for the client. We will build a solution using the CaseFabric platform to support her and her**

**co-workers to collaboratively do their job. The job is successfully finished when both Civix and the client are satisfied in creating a home solution for him.**

Handling the case is very specific to the client. His personal situation will drive a lot of the choices that will be made. Also there are many privacy aspects and security aspects involved.

***We will now build the solution that will support Lana to execute the client dossier.***
