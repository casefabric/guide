## Introduction

[Mendix](https://mendix.com) is a low code platform used by many customers building applications.
CaseFabric introduces a [DCM Marketplace Add-On](url to marketplace) that allows you to use CaseFabric 
inside Mendix for designing and running Dynamic Case Management applications. 

## What is available

After installation of the DCM Marketplace Add-0n, you will have the option to design case models 
right from Studio Pro - See [Design Case Models](designmodels) for more information.

These models are thereafter available in the Mendix Runtime and a number of java actions allow you
to start an instance of the designed model and interact with it down the line by using the provided 
Case Management actions. [[Using Cases]](usecases.md) explains more on how to interact with the case
model within your application.

## Inside the Mendix Runtime

CaseFabric Dynamic Case Management runs **inside** the Mendix App being built. 
There is no need for additional servers or services to build a fully functioning
case management application. The Mendix app created can be deployed on any existing 
Mendix runtime environment.

More information on the structure of the DCM module for mendix is found at the 
[Architecture](architecture) page.

## Availability

The CaseFabric DCM module for Mendix is available as of Mendix 10.24 and currently only
available on request (it is limited available). Trying out DCM in development mode makes use
of the same restrictions as Mendix (limited number of hours running) and for production
applications, you need a DCM license. 

For the license you can contact Mendix sales.
