## Supported databases

In order to use the DCM module, you need to have Postgres (preferred) or MS SQL Server. 

## Start Case cannot find my case

When you create a new case model and want to use it, you need to Deploy the model inside the DCM editor.
See [Deploy the model](designmodels#deploy-the-model) for all the details. 
Note that you do not need to restart after pressing the deploy button.
