# Hello Pekko! 


## Hello Pekko (and thank you Akka)
Akka served us more than 10 years with a great runtime framework, and we're really thankful for that.
<br/>
With this release the case engine moves in a smooth and compatible manner to a new underlying runtime based on [Pekko](https://pekko.apache.org/).

### Is it small or is it big? 
Well, it is a big step for us, but a small step for you. The only thing required is to make some modifications to the engine configuration file.
<br/>Examples can be found in the [configuration page](../engine/configuration).

## Improved Azure connectivity
This release enables connecting to a database in Azure with [Azure managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).


## Housekeeping & security updates
A few underlying external dependencies have been updated the latest versions.
The build infrastructure has been upgraded to prepare for improved internal quality measurements.
