# More multitasking

This release brings a major extension to the Task API for case instances.
Furthermore it comes with some internal refactoring, small bug fixes and enhancements. 

## Extended task information on cases
The API to fetch tasks for a case has been extended to include a lot more usable information.
It is now possible to read tasks from not just the case, but also from all subcases of that case - provided the user has access to the subcase.
Furthermore, a new property `mayPerform` is added to each human task, indicating whether the user has the rights to perform the task.

## Housekeeping
The core engine architecture consists of 2 major components. First and foremorst the pure case handling, and in addition the tenant registration.
The tenant registration is intended to support the precise authorization structures in the case handling.
In most use cases such a registration is also done outside of the engine, and this leads to cumbersome data duplication.
This release prepares a next step to make the registration more pluggable to avoid data duplication.
