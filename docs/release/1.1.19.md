# Fixpack

This release primarily holds a couple of fixes for the Case Team APIs with respect to consent group membership.

Furthermore this release holds a little extension on process task input mappings.

## Richer sub process input mappings
Process task implementations, such as HTTPCall and MailDefinition expose string based parameter substitution.
This has been extended with support for SPEL expressions. If the engine finds a string substitution `${ ... }` it will try to parse the contents as a SPEL expression, and as an alternative provide the string value of the parameter.
