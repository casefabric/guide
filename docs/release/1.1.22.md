# Where do you come from?

One of the major new features in this release of Cafienne is the support for multiple Identity Providers with [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/). This means that users can use the Cafienne Engine with tokens that can come from different backgrounds.
Furthermore, the configurations for OIDC has been greatly simplified with dynamic IDP metadata resolution when only the `issuer URL` is provided.

## Experimental: Public Events
A new feature is introduced that exposes the internal events of the Case Engine through a higher level public API that provides for more easy access on streaming implementations.
Note that this is an experimental feature, the actual APIs will mature over time and may undergo changes that are not backwards compatible.

## New API for Case Event History
The existing API to retrieve plan item history worked on a projection table. This table is dropped from the Query DB schema, and the history is now always retrieved based on the latest events within the case.
Furthermore, it is now possible to retrieve the entire list of events of the case. This API is recommended over the plan item history API.

## Performance & Monitoring Improvements
The APIs to retrieve tasks have undergone a massive performance improvement (by factors of 20).
The Health Monitor includes a new measure point for the internal Timer Service; furthermore it no longer blocks the HTTP requests upon write journal issues, as these are reported directly to the user.

## Housekeeping
A lot of internal refactoring has been done, in additiona to some major updates on the underlying dependencies, with a special note on the Cassandra Event Journal plugin from `0.107` to `1.0.6` using much newer Java dependencies underneath.
