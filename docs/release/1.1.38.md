# Extended Migration Support

This release has extended the support for migration of case definitions on running instances

## More migration support

The case engine is now able to detect plan items such as Tasks, Milestones or Stages that have moved into a different area of the case plan.
A typical use case scenario is a case that started with a relatively simple HumanTask to do an intake, but over time the intake appears to be a somewhat more complex phase 
with multiple tasks is better expressed in a stage.
Migrating running cases with an active Intake task now preserves the state of that task, whilst moving it to the newly introduced stage.

Also the other way around is possible, where a task is moved from a stage to a higher stage because it should be available earlier and perhaps in more places.

## Housekeeping

Traditional housekeeping has taken place as well. We love a clean house.
