# Case Migration extended to Process Tasks

Release [1.1.16 Sweet Sixteen](https://github.com/casefabric/cafienne-engine/releases/tag/1.1.16) introduced a real gem with initial support for runtime migration on individual case instances.
With this release 1.1.21 support for Process Tasks has been added.

## Extended case migration scenarios
The number of migration scenarios is mind-boggling, but daily practice shows that there is a heavy need for this functionality when "fixing bugs" on the case definition of a running instance.
These can be typically related to CMMN antipatterns but just as much to unexpected expression language failures.
A specific pattern that was encountered is a failing process task that fails upon start. The underlying akka mechanism does not store events for that, and in this release we have added some functional events in order to have better tracking on these situations.
The migration implementation has also been extended to elegantly deal with this type of situation.

## New docker base image
Up until release 1.1.20, the base docker image for the Cafienne engine was the [openjdk:17-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk).
This image has been deprecated, and Cafienne now uses [eclipse-temurin:17.0.3_7-jre-jammy](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin).

## Housekeeping
Underlying dependencies of the engine have been updated as much as possible.
