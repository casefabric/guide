# Archival & Deletion
This release introduces a new experimental feature with pluggable support for Archival & Deletion.
Please note that the feature is experimental - we may enhance or change the APIs in a future release.
> This initial implementation is sponsored by [Visionplanner](https://www.visionplanner.com), for which we are very thankful.

## Support for Archival
**Archive and restore a case with it's sub cases and process tasks.**

Cafienne now supports an implementation for archiving cases.

By default, the archive is written to disk as a json document.
Custom implementations of the Storage interface can archive to and restore from other cold storage mechanisms.

## Support for Deletion
**Delete a case or even a tenant with all it's cases.**

In addition to the new archiving feature, this release also provides support for full deletion of cases and tenants.
Deleting a tenant will also delete all the cases inside that tenant.

## More CMMN compliance
This release comes with two fixes that make the engine even more CMMN compliant than it already was.
One of the strongest features of CMMN is it's declarative nature. This release fixes a nasty little bug in which the engine was not completely agnostic to the order of the plan item elements within the XML definitions file. No need to worry about order in your flows any longer!
