# Continuous Improvement

A product is never complete. Continuous improvement is the most robust manner to deal with that.
Even as little as it is - it _is_ an improvement and therefore we proudly announce our 20th release.

## Housekeeping

This release fixes a couple of minor issues in the engine, most importantly making the case team behavior consistent across tenant roles and consent group roles.
Furthermore this release is a next step towards creating a fully reactive streams oriented engine.
