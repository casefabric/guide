# Robustness all around

This release improves various robustness aspects in the product.

## Improved communication between cases
The underlying Apache Pekko runtime does not guarantee message delivery. Documentation on this can be found on the [Pekko documentation](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko/current/general/message-delivery-reliability.html) website.
This behavior could every now and then lead to loss of communication between cases and its casetasks or processtasks.
The new release of the engine adds a layer of request and acknowledge to ensure a more stable communication.

## Improved archival & deletion
When a case is archived or deleted, and it had timers running, these were not removed from the internal TimerService.
This issue is now fixed, and a test case was added to ensure that when a case with a timer is archived, it also newly sets the timer when the case is restored.

## More precise authorization
Up until this release, a case that was started always had to have at least one case team member that was directly referring to a user id.
From now on it is also possible to start cases that have only a consent group assigned or a tenant role.

## Enhance IDP configurations
Some identity providers extend the [default JWT claims](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#page-9). The case engine uses the value of the `sub` claim to establish the user identity. From this release onwards it is possible to configure a different claim to read this information. 

## Smaller runtime footprint
Various process task implementations (such as email and pdf generation) have been separated in an independent jar file that is no longer part of the docker image of the case engine.
At a later stage a jar file with the plugins will become available in a maven repository.
If you need this functionality now, kindly get in touch with us and we can help you out.
