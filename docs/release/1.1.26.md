# Security Pack

This release contains a number of security updates of the underlying jar files in use, including a shift to scala 2.13.11 and sbt 1.9.0.
Furthermore it contains a couple of smaller enhancements and fixes.

## Improved case migration

When a case definition is modified with e.g. new role names, it is a typical use case to also change the case team membership and assign that new role to one or more team members. This can now be achieved within the call to migrate the definition of a case instance.

## Housekeeping

A lot of refactoring has been done to simplify and unify patterns in the engine code.
