# Upgrades under the hood

Cafienne version 1.1.15 comes with updates on the underlying dependencies, most notably the upgrade from scala 2.12 to 2.13.

## Engine handles HumanTasks with more distance
Cafienne Engine and Generic UI had a sort of implicit contract requiring HumanTasks to carry a proprietary field holding a JSON document.
The engine has taken some distance from this, and now any string value in the same, including empty strings. This can be used to transport your own proprietary task format, e.g. a url to a custom website.

## More debug logging
The logback.xml settings for DEBUG give a more precise logging to print the offset of the latest event that is handled by the materializers on the query database. This gives a better indication on how far the engine has processed events from the event database.

## Housekeeping
The internal build street has been further optimized according to the fail-fast principle.
The engine code has undergone cleansing of many java and scala warnings.
Furthermore this release contains some code refactoring to prepare for exciting new functionality.
