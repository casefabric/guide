# Workflow Extensions

This release adds two important workflow patterns to the engine, the four-eyes principle and the rendez-vous principle, explained below.
In addition this release has some bugfixes and extensions related to the case migration functionality.

## Four-Eyes and Rendez-Vous principle

One of the typical patterns in a series of tasks on a case is that some of them have to be done by different people. If someone handed in a document for review, that person cannot also be assigned with the task to review the document.
This principle of having two tasks done by two distinct persons is also called the "Four Eyes principle".
The opposite of this principle is called "Rendez Vous". In this situation, 2 (or more) distinct tasks must be done by the same person. For example, if the reviewer of the document decides that review comments must be processed before the document can be completed, the task to handle the review comments must be assigned to the same person that submitted the document.
The power of these principles is not limited to pairs of tasks. It is also possible to define "Four Eyes" on 3 different tasks each excluding the other two, what effectively means that the 3 tasks have to be done by 3 different users.

## Extended case migration support

The updated definition on a main case is always propagated into the entire chain of sub cases (and sub-sub cases, etc.).
Until this release it was possible to invoke the migration API on both cases and their sub cases. This may easily lead to mistakes in updating e.g. the sub case also with the new definition - even though the initial update also tried to achieve the same.
With this release the API now has a restriction to prevent direct updates on sub cases.
Note: in order to update only the subcase, we can still update the definition of the main case that includes the modified sub case definition.
The engine will notice that the only change is in the definition of the sub case, and only that definition will actually get updated.

Furthermore with this release when a case is migrated to a new definition along with a new team this team update is propagated into sub cases.
