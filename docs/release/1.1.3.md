## Fixpack

This release fixes a Health Monitor issue in [1.1.2](https://github.com/casefabric/cafienne-engine/releases/tag/1.1.2). 

The Health Monitor rejects incoming service requests if the Case Engine is not healthy. Not healthy means that dependent components such as databases or Identity Providers (IDP) cannot be reached.
When the dependent components can be reached again, the Case Engine is healthy again, and the Health Monitor should open up for incoming service requests.
This release fixes that IDP connectivity recovery is tried before rejecting the incoming service requests (instead of the other way around).
