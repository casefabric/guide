# Hotfix

This release fixes an incomplete fix in [release 1.1.30](1.1.30.md).
When the case task fails, output mappings without expressions were no longer executed, but those with expressions still were, potentially leading to failures.
That is now fixed.

Also the Swagger documentation was enriched on response messages of REST calls.
