## Major Authorization Extensions

This release holds a number of major enhancements to the core of the platform.

## Complete overhaul of the core Authorization model

The internal engine authorization for both querying cases and acting on them is now fully executed at the level of the individual case instance. Each case has it's own team, and that team is the only team that has access to the case. Searching for cases or tasks will only produce results if you are member of the case team. Working on cases and tasks can only be done if you are a member of the case team.

Case team membership has been redefined to support membership based on user id or role name. In addition, the notion of case ownership has been added, and only case owners can modify the case team.

More information can be found online in the [Cafienne Guide](https://cafienne.github.io/docs/api/case-team.html)

## Enhanced search capabilities with Business Identifiers

Within the case definition a new option has been added to determine certain properties in the case file as business identifiers. Searching cases or tasks can be extended to include filtering on these properties and their values.
More information and examples can be found in the [Cafienne Guide on Business Identifiers](https://cafienne.github.io/docs/extensions/business-identifiers.html)

## More Deployment flexibility
The default Cafienne deployment scheme was based on a simple file system repository. This approach does not lend itself for complex multi-tenant deployments.
A new DefinitionProvider has been implemented giving full flexibility when starting a case instance.
The Cafienne Guide has a new page called [Repository](https://cafienne.github.io/docs/engine/repository.html) describing the details.

Until this release, creation of tenants could only be done with a list of owners for the new tenant. Adding users to the tenant had to be done separately by the tenant owners. With this release, the creation of tenants can be done with the entire list of tenant users instead of just the tenant owners. Obviously that list must have at least one owner. 

## Backwards Compatibility
Yes. 100%.
Indeed.
As always.

## Query Database Updates
The schema of the internal query-db that Cafienne uses to implement the various querying APIs has been refactored to fit the above new features. 
In addition quite a few new indices have been added, and all foreign key relationships have been removed.
**No need to update manually**  - the first time Cafienne Engine is started with the new release, the updates are performed automatically.

## Housekeeping
This release holds various dependency updates, e.g. on latest JDBC drivers.
Furthermore a lot of internal restructuring and extensions to tests have been added.
