# Fixpack++

This release holds a fix for an issue introduced in release 1.1.16 on the evaluation of the repetition rule.
Furthermore it holds a major upgrade of the build structure enriching the jar file that is published in maven.

## Richer jar file in maven
The internal project structure has been simplified from multiple modules into a single project, resulting in a single jar file that contains the entire engine logic.
This enables custom integrations of Cafienne within your own project. If you want to do this and need help, feel free to contact us.
