# Maintenance Release

This release brings some major internal changes to the engine, that help running it inside your own JVM.
Furthermore it comes with some internal refactoring, small bug fixes and enhancements.

## Improved case-id generation
The generation of case instance ids has been updated to use an algorithm that is more database friendly.
In technical language: the guid generation is now based on UUID v7, which is much better for database indices.

## Extended migration support on entry criteria
Migrating the definition of individual case instances relies heavily on the current state of the case.
Specifically the complex structures that tie different parts of the case together (the so-called "Sentry Network") has been improved.

## Internal API enhancements
For running the case engine as a jar file included in your own code, we now expose better APIs that are more precise and descriptive.
Also the internal LastModifiedRegistration has been extended with a mechanism to use the correlation id of a command to wait for the full event processing before executing a query.

## Extended task information
A new property `caseName` is added to the response of fetching tasks. This can help in creating task overviews across multiple different types of cases.

## Housekeeping
External dependencies have been updated to newest versions. Also the build street has been enhanced with better code coverage measurements.
