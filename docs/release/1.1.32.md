# Enhanced and Simplified Task Management


This release improves the management of tasks.
Until now, when a task was e.g. claimed or delegated only the case owners could change that assignment.
This requires additional organizational overhead when e.g. a person is ill and the task assigned to that person first needs to be revoked by the case owner before a colleague with the same role can take over the task.

This restriction has been removed, and the task management can now be done by anyone with the appropriate case role.

## Housekeeping & security updates
A few underlying external dependencies have been updated the latest versions.
