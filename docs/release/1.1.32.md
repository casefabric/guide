# Enhanced and Simplified Task Management


This release improves the management of tasks.
Until now, when a task was e.g. claimed or delegated only the case owners could change that assignment.
This requires additional organizational overhead when e.g. a person is ill and the task assigned to that person first needs to be revoked by the case owner before a colleague with the same role can take over the task.

This restriction has been removed, and the task management can now be done by anyone with the appropriate case role.

## Housekeeping & security updates
A few underlying external dependencies have been updated the latest versions.


## Tickets closed
#438 Task delegation should not give the delegate a case role in the team - it should only delegate this particular task
#439 Task management authorizations should not restrict to only case owners, but to anyone with the appropriate case role
#440 It should be possible to claim a task when it is already claimed by or assigned to someone else
